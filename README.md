# Translator-Project
Personal Translator Project 

This is my personal translator project. I got this idea after being unable to get direct translations from livestreams in languages I did not know (mostly japanese livestreams). I am using ktinker to create a small interactive interface to be able to translate statements. Also, I integrated Speech Recognition in order to enable speech to text translation. 

Language Used: Python
Modules: ktinker, googletrans, speech_recognition, pyttsx3

Based on the https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/python-language-translator/ tutorial.
